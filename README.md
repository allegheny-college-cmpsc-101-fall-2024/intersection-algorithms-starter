## Introduction

In this engineering lab, you will implement a CLI that will allow you run
intersection algorithms in four different ways. Additionally, the performance
of the algorithms will be tested empirically, and the empirical data will be
analyzed by you to build analysis skills and intuition about code performance.

## Learning Objectives

1. Implement intersection algorithms
2. Run an empirical timing experiment and analyze the empirical data
3. Understand trade-offs between data types
4. Use professional linting and formatting tools
5. Write clearly about the programming concepts in this assignment

## Project Details ([Project Overview](#project-overview) Below)

### Project Goals

This assignment invites you to implement a program that features multiple
algorithms for computing the intersection between a data container.
Specifically, you will implement and experimentally evaluate the following
intersection algorithms: (i) a `list`-based approach with a single `for` loop,
(ii) a `list`-based approach with a double `for` loop, (iii) a `tuple`-based
approach with a single `for` loop, and (iv) a `tuple`-based approach with a
double `for` loop. In addition to adding source code to the provided Python
files, you will conduct an experiment to determine which algorithm is the
fastest and estimate by how much it is faster.

### Expected Output

This project invites you to implement a data container intersection problem
called `intersection`. After you finish a correct implementation of all the
program's features, running it with the command `poetry run intersection
--number 10000 --maximum 25 --profile --approach ListDouble` will produce output
like the following. This output shows that it took approximately `2.210` seconds
to compute the intersection of two `list`s that each contain `10,000` randomly
generated values with the maximum value in each `list` being `25`. Importantly,
this invocation of the `intersection` program configures it to run the
`ListDouble` algorithm that uses a doubly-nested `for` loop to compute the
intersection of the `list`s. Did you notice that this program produces profiling
data about how long it took to run the `intersection` program with the
`ListDouble` algorithm? This is because of the fact that it uses the
[Pyinstrument](https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument) package to collect
execution traces and efficiency information about the program.

```shell
ðŸ”¬ Here's profiling data from computing an intersection with random data
containers of 10000!

  _     ._   __/__   _ _  _  _ _/_   Recorded: 14:01:19  Samples:  2207
 /_//_/// /_\ / //_// / //_'/ //     Duration: 2.211     CPU time: 2.203
/   _/                      v4.0.3

Program: intersection --number 10000 --maximum 25 --profile --approach ListDouble

2.210 intersection  intersection/main.py:99
â””â”€ 2.210 compute_intersection_list_double  intersection/main.py:53
   â”œâ”€ 2.051 [self]
   â””â”€ 0.159 list.append  <built-in>:0
         [2 frames hidden]  <built-in>
```

It is worth noting that you do not have to run `intersection` in the `profile`
mode that uses Pyinstrument. For instance, running the program with `poetry run
intersection --number 10 --maximum 25 --display --approach ListDouble` would run
the program with the `ListDouble` algorithm and perform the same computation
without collecting the performance data. When run with this command,
`intersection` would produce output like the following. Note that when the
program is run with the `--display` flag and without the `--profile` flag it
shows the two input data containers and their computed intersection &mdash;
without reporting any details about the efficiency of the algorithm. This mode
is ideal when you want to confirm that your implementation of `intersection` is
perform the correct computation and less useful when you are running experiments
to study the program's performance.

```shell
âœ¨ Here are the details about the intersection computation!

Performed intersection with:
---> the first data container: [22, 10, 21, 11, 2, 7, 4, 16, 22, 23]
---> the second data container: [16, 17, 23, 24, 12, 4, 21, 1, 18, 19]
Computed the intersection as the data container: [21, 4, 16, 23]
```

Don't forget that you can display `intersection`'s help menu and learn more
about its features by typing `poetry run intersection --help` to display the
following:

```shell

```

Continue reading to understand what functionality to add to the source code.

### Adding Functionality

If you study the file `intersection/intersection/main.py` you will see that it
has many `TODO` markers that designate the parts of the program that you need to
implement before `intersection` will produce correct output. To ensure that the
program works correctly, you must implement all of these functions before you
start to run the experiments.

- `def generate_random_container(size: int, maximum: int, make_tuple: bool = False) -> Union[List[int], Tuple[int, ...]]`
- `def compute_intersection_list_double(input_one: List[Any], input_two: List[Any]) -> List[Any]`
- `def compute_intersection_list_single(input_one: List[Any], input_two: List[Any]) -> List[Any]`

The function called `generate_random_container` should automatically create
either a `tuple` or a `list` of the specified `size` and only containing values
that are less than or equal to the `maximum`. The function called
`compute_intersection_list_single` should follow the implementation strategy of
its counterpart function called `compute_intersection_tuple_single` while still
using the functions appropriate for the `list` structured type. Moreover, the
`compute_intersection_list_double` should follow the implementation of
`compute_intersection_tuple_double` except for the fact that it should populate
a `list` through the use of a doubly-nested `for` loop. As a reference, here is
the source code for the `compute_intersection_tuple_single` function:

```python linenums="1"
def compute_intersection_tuple_single(
    input_one: Tuple[Any, ...], input_two: Tuple[Any, ...]
) -> Tuple[Any, ...]:
    """Compute the intersection of two provided tuples."""
    result: Tuple[Any, ...] = ()
    for element in input_one:
        if element in input_two:
            result += (element,)
    return result
```

According to the type signature of this function on lines `1` and `2`, the
`compute_intersection_tuple_single` function accepts as input two `tuples` that
can contain `Any` type of data and be of an arbitrary size. Lines `6` through
`8` of this function show that it uses the combination of a `for` loop and an
`if` statement to compute the intersection of the `tuple`s called `input_one`
and `input_two`. After finding those elements that these `tuple`s contain in
common, `compute_intersection_tuple_single` returns the `result` on line `9`.
Since this function processes `tuple`s it is possible that the intersection of
the input parameters will be a `result` that contains a value more than once. It
is also worth noting that, since the `tuple` structured type is immutable, this
function uses the `+=` operator on line `8` to create a new `tuple` each time
that it adds data to the `result` variable. You will empirically study the
efficiency of this approach!

After finishing your implementation of `intersection` you should conduct an
experiment to evaluate the efficiency of the different algorithms that it
provides. You should refer to the `writing/reflection.md` file for more details
about the experiment that you should conduct and how you must configure the
`intersection` program to collect data. Ultimately, you need to answer the
following three research questions:

- Is the intersection of two data containers faster with a `list` or a `tuple`?
- Is the intersection of two data containers faster with a double or single `for` loop?
- Overall, what is the fastest approach for computing the intersection of two
  data containers?

## Running Checks

### Helper Tasks

Helper tasks are run in the terminal with the poetry environment activated.
The format of the commands are always `poetry run task xyz`...where `xyz`
is the helper task name.

If you study the source code in the `pyproject.toml` file you will see that it
includes the following section that specifies different executable "helper
task" names like `ruff`, `fix`, `ruffdetails`, etc.

```toml
[tool.taskipy.tasks]
```

If you are in the `intersection` directory that contains the
`pyproject.toml` file and the `poetry.lock` file, the tasks in this section
make it easy to run commands like `poetry run task ruff` to automatically run
the ruff linter designed to check the Python source code in your program and
its test suite to confirm that your source code adheres to the industry-standard.
You can also use the command `poetry run task fix` to automatically reformat the
source code. `poetry run task ruffdetails` will print out detailed linting errors
that point to exactly what ruff views as a linting error. Make sure to examine
the `pyproject.toml` file for other convenient tasks that you can use to both
check and improve your project!

### Gatorgrade

The command `gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml` will check your work. If
your work meets the baseline requirements and adheres to the best practices that
proactive programmers adopt you will see that all the checks pass when you run
`gatorgrade`. Try to pass as many checks as you can. Missing some checks will only
impact a part of your grade in this Engineering Lab. Note, modifications to the
gatorgrade.yml file are not permitted without explicit instruction.

### Pytest

If your program has all
of the anticipated functionality, you can run the command `poetry run task test`
and see that the test suite produces output like the following. Can you add
comments to the test suite to explain how the test cases work?

```shell
collected 4 items

tests/test_intersection.py .......
```

## Project Reflection

Once you have finished both of the previous technical tasks, you can use a text
editor to answer all of the questions in the `writing/reflection.md` file. For
instance, you should provide the output of the Python program in a fenced code
block, explain the meaning of the Python source code segments that you
implemented, and answer all of the other questions about your experiences in
completing this project. A specific goal of the reflection for this project is
to evaluate the efficiency of the different algorithms and data containers
implemented as part of the `intersection` program. When you are writing your
performance evaluation make sure that you both explain what performance trends
are evident and why you think the algorithms yield these trends. Finally, you
should reflect on how the experimental evaluation of a program's performance is
more nuanced than you might have initially expected before starting to work on
this project.

## Project Assessment

Since this project is an engineering effort, it is aligned with the
**evaluating** and **creating** levels of [Bloom's
taxonomy](/proactive-learning/blooms-taxonomy/). You can learn more about how a
proactive programming expert will assess your work by examining the [assessment
strategy](/proactive-learning/assessment-strategy/). From the start to the end
of this project you may make an unlimited number of reattempts at submitting
source code and technical writing that meet all aspects of the project's
specification.
